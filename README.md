# PathogenMarkers

There is now a wealth of publicly available gene expression data available for re-analysis. The advance of informatics sometimes would give us unexpected but convincing results. The results could be used for multiple purpose: (1) a new diagnostic or prognostic test for the disease of interest, (2) a better understanding of the underlying biology. 

## Influenza 

IFI27 based classifier has been reported as a biomarker to discriminate influenza and bacterial infections. OASL was then identified. The diagnostic performance of these two genes were compared on three external datasets (evaluation_OASL_IFI27.R).
